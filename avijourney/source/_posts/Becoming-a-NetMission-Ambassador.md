## Introduction 🎉
Hello everyone! Whenever I find the time, I delight in sharing my journey and experiences through blogging. 

## My Graduation 🎓
I am thrilled to announce my graduation from the NetMission Academy, which was officially marked on February 22, 2024. Starting from December 14, 2023, every Thursday at 6 PM IST, it has been an immensely rewarding journey of learning and growth.

## The NetMission Experience 🌐
NetMission Academy offered a series of online sessions aimed at equipping young minds with the knowledge and skills necessary to engage in Internet policymaking. The program included informative webinars, interactive workshops, and a closing ceremony—all facilitated by expert guest speakers.

## Working Group Dynamics 👥
Within the academy, I was a member of working group 3 (WG#3), a team of incredible individuals like Barkha Manral, Sanduni Sathsara, Noor, and Alya Rezal. We all played an active role and were responsible for tasks such as session summaries, speaker questions, and case studies.

## Case Studies Focus 🔍
Our working group selected "Diversity, Inclusion & Sustainability on the Internet & Internet Governance" as our theme for the case studies. We zoomed into “Olam's digital transformation and climate action in Singapore” and “Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and advocating renewable energy” as our focal projects.
