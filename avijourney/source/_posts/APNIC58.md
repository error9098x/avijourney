Hello again! I'm excited to share my experience at APNIC 58. Being in the Internet Governance space, I've always been fascinated by how Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) work. Let me take you through my journey.

## Understanding RIRs and APNIC

First, let's break down what RIRs are. Think of them as the guardians of the internet's addressing system. There are five RIRs globally, and in our Asia-Pacific region, we have APNIC (Asia Pacific Network Information Centre), headquartered in Brisbane, Australia.

APNIC plays a crucial role in managing internet resources - they're basically the ones who ensure IP addresses are distributed fairly across the Asia Pacific's 56 economies. It's like being the property registrar for the internet! They don't just hand out IP addresses; they're actively involved in developing the regional Internet community, providing training, and participating in internet governance.

## The Fellowship Program

I applied for the APNIC Fellowship to attend APNIC 58 in Wellington, New Zealand, and guess what? I got selected! The program aims to:
- Help people understand and participate in APNIC's policy development
- Create networking opportunities with industry peers
- Support internet community members from developing economies

## Pre-Conference Training

Before the actual conference, we had fascinating weekly sessions covering everything from IPv6 to network security. It was like my university networking course, but with real-world applications!

I chose the Network Security track, and it was incredible! We covered:
- Network Security Fundamentals
- Device & Infrastructure Security
- DDoS Attacks and Countermeasures
- BGP Route Hijack Prevention
- Vulnerability Assessment
- And much more!

The daily Kahoot quizzes kept us engaged, and the networking breaks were fantastic - I met CERTs, network engineers, and fellow students from across the region.

## APNIC 58 Conference

The conference kicked off with a beautiful Maori cultural performance by young kids. The sessions were packed with insights about IPv6 deployment and disaster resilience. I particularly enjoyed the open policy meetings where everyone voiced their opinions on proposed policies.

## Final Thoughts

The best part? APNIC makes all their learning materials freely available. You can find the course materials I used here: [APNIC Academy Events](https://academy.apnic.net/en/events?id=a0BOc000000O9VBMA0)

This experience wasn't just about learning technical concepts - it was about understanding how the internet's governance actually works and meeting amazing people who keep our digital world running smoothly.
