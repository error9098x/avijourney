Since the first semester of my course, I had been trying to create a coding environment in our college. I was always inclined to programming and helping my peers. I applied for GDSC lead in my 1st year of college - there was no GDSC in our college before, being from the first batch of computer science engineering. Though I wasn't selected initially, this didn't stop us.

Me and my peers piloted our first session about basics of web development as a team, and we called ourselves "Dev Team".

Here's a glimpse of me presenting about publishing websites on Vercel as a free hosting platform. From that experience, I wanted to create a bigger footprint of our work in the college, so I applied for GDSC again, and thankfully got selected as the GDSC lead. We finally got the official status of a student developer club on our campus.

## Amazing Core Team Support

I want to express my gratitude to our incredible core team:
- **Aniket Shahi** (co-lead) - for helping with permissions, dealing with management, and working efficiently for successful events
- **Pratham** - for preparing the Capture The Flag session, making it beginner-friendly and enjoyable
- **Shiv Awasthi** - for collaborating on the AI/ML Session, helping everyone understand Hugging Face and the model development process
- **Adarsh** - our design lead for all the beautiful designs
- **Rupam** - for managing the swag parcels and shipping logistics, which was quite challenging

## Special Achievements

We managed to secure sponsorship for our college GDSC cups, featuring a really well-made design:

During my term, we faced numerous challenges - from management issues to budget constraints and exam schedules. However, we moved forward together, conducting sessions successfully. One of our major achievements was completing both Google Study Jams, with over 80 students fully completing all the Google Cloud labs.

## Google AI Day Experience

Towards the end of my tenure, I was invited to the Google Office in Bangalore for the Google AI Day event. It was an incredible experience meeting other GDSC leads from different campuses, sharing our struggles and experiences.

## Looking Forward

As of 2024, GDSC has transformed into GDG (Google Developer Groups) on campus. I'm passing the torch to Joysa Kaushik, our new GDG on-campus representative. It has been an exciting journey that I'll always cherish, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have served as a GDSC lead.

Good luck to the new team! ðŸš€
