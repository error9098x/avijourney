Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aviral - a student, tinkerer, and cybersecurity enthusiast currently digging deep into the bits and bytes at National Forensic Sciences University, Delhi Campus. I'm all about exploring the intersections of techâ€”whether that's getting messy with machine learning, unraveling puzzles in AI, or securing the digital chasms of cybersecurity.

When I'm not buried under textbooks or hacking away at my keyboard for the next big CTF showdown, you might find me conjuring up algorithms or piecing together data puzzles that tickle my brain. ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

Cybersecurity isn't just a study path for me; it's a voyage. Every CTF (Capture The Flag) challenge is a treasure hunt, and alongside my teammate, we dive headfirst, sometimes finding ourselves among the top contenders!
Outside the digital world, I'm just a regular person who enjoys a good chat over coffee â˜• about anything tech. Got a cool tech idea or a brainstorming query? Hit me up! Letâ€™s connect and plot the coordinates to navigate this tech labyrinth together.
